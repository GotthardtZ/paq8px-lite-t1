ABOUT
-----

PAQ is a series of experimental lossless data compression software that have gone 
through collaborative development to top rankings on several benchmarks measuring 
compression ratio (although at the expense of speed and memory usage).

PAQ8PX-lite (this branch) is a fork from PAQ8PX (https://github.com/hxim/paq8px) 
in 2021 by Zoltán Gothardt tuned for the "Global Data Compression Competition 2021" 
Test-set 1 "Qualitative Data (filtered Chinese Wikipedia DB)"

HOW TO COMPILE
--------------

Building PAQ8PX-LITE requires a C++17 capable C++ compiler:
https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support#cpp17

Windows 
To build an executable you may use the Visual Studio solution
file or in case of Mingw-w64 see the "build-mingw-w64-generic-publish.cmd" batch file
in the /build subfolder.

Linux/macOS
gcc users may run the build/build-linux.sh script or use the following commands to build:

 sudo apt-get install build-essential
 g++ -fno-rtti -std=gnu++1z -DNDEBUG -O3 -m64 -march=native -mtune=native -flto -fwhole-program  ../file/*.cpp ../model/*.cpp ../*.cpp -opaq8px.exe 

The following compilers were tested and verified to compile/work correctly:

  - Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition 16.10.4 (Windows)
  - MinGW-w64 9.3.0 (Windows)
  - GCC 10.3.0 (Lubuntu)
